# TO-DO-LIST
I developed a comprehensive To-Do List application utilizing Express, body-parser, and PostgreSQL. This application features robust functionality for adding, editing, and deleting tasks, ensuring seamless integration with a PostgreSQL database for persistent data management. I employed EJS for dynamic templating, which allowed for the creation of a responsive and user-friendly interface. Additionally, I managed all CRUD operations within PostgreSQL to maintain consistent and reliable data storage and retrieval. This project highlights my ability to create full-stack applications with a focus on both backend efficiency and frontend responsiveness.
